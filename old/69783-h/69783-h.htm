</div>

<p class='c007'>The following systematic notes have been accumulated in connection
with economic studies of Puerto Rico<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> palms, and although
the list is doubtless still incomplete, the printing of it may be justified
as a means of securing at least provisional names needed for
reference purposes in connection with other publications of a non-systematic
character.</p>

<p class='c009'>The palms may well be considered a very refractory group
when handled by the conventional methods of systematic botany.
Difficult at once to collect or to study from dried material, they
are commonly neglected both in the field and in the herbarium,
with the result that literature is scanty and unsatisfactory. A very
large proportion of the descriptions are entirely inadequate for the
identification of species, and there has been much lawlessness and
diversity in the application of generic names, as will appear from
some of the instances discussed below. Difficulties of description
and classification have also been multiplied by the fact that the
palms are such peculiar plants that analogies and criteria borrowed
from other families are often inapplicable and misleading. Moreover,
the terminology of parts and characters has not been developed
to the point where the expression of observed differences is
easy, and available language often fails completely to suggest
the significance of the characters used. Thus the fibers into which
parts of the leaf-bases of many palms are resolved afford many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>diagnostic characters, for which we have no parallels in other
groups of plants.</p>

<p class='c009'>A compensating advantage may be drawn, however, from the
definite and often very limited geographical distribution of the
species of palms. Thus, although Puerto Rico is a relatively
small island, several of the indigenous palms have apparently
ranged in nature over but a small part of it, and a locality definitely
indicated would often go further toward establishing the
identity of a species than much of the descriptive matter prepared
for this purpose. For the present, at least, the geographical idea
should be kept uppermost in systematic studies of the palms, since
it is generally much easier and far more logical to extend the limits
of supposed distribution and unite supposed species, than to cope
with the confusion caused by the miscellaneous reporting of species
far outside their natural ranges.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the popular standpoint another serious inconvenience of
the systematic literature of palms arises from the fact that it is
based so largely on floral characters that even the botanical traveler
might need to wait months for the blossoms and then climb the
trees or cut them down before being able to secure a clue to botanical
names or relationships. But however necessary refinements of
formal characters may be in presenting classifications or monographs
of large groups, more obvious differences may still be
adequate for distinguishing between the species, genera and families
represented in a limited flora like that of Puerto Rico. In
the present paper use is made therefore of obvious external differences,
not only because of the greater convenience and utility of
such facts in field study but also in the belief that with the palms,
at least, the vegetative, habitat and ecological features are often
quite as important for diagnostic purposes as the more technical and
conventionalized characters to which botanists are accustomed in
dealing with other natural orders.</p>

<p class='c009'>As will be apparent from some of the following systematic notes,
the generic nomenclature of the palms is in a condition closely
comparable to that now known to obtain among the myxomycetes,
fungi, hepaticae and ferns. Possibly the palms have suffered more
from neglect and carelessness than other groups of flowering plants,
but it can no longer be maintained that the practical defects of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>former taxonomic methods do not exist in the phanerogams as well
as in the cryptogams, and it becomes obvious that the enactment
of different nomenclatorial legislation for these two subdivisions of
the vegetable kingdom would be unreasonable and inconsistent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The present list records twenty palms from Puerto Rico, of
which three are introduced and seventeen are supposed to be native
species. As may also be inferred from many other groups of
plants Puerto Rico appears to be a rather remote corner of the
Antillean region, which many types present in Cuba and Jamaica
did not reach, whether by reason of greater distance from the continent
or because of an earlier interruption of land communication.
The native palms of Puerto Rico may thus be said to represent a
distinctly Antillean or Caribbean series, only <i>Acrocomia</i> and <i>Bactris</i>
being known to have a wider distribution.</p>

<p class='c009'>The list of introduced palms, consisting of the date, the cocoanut,
and the betel, might have been somewhat increased by canvassing
ornamental gardens, but it does not appear that any other introduced
species has been put to any useful purpose or has escaped
into general culture, certainly a remarkable fact when we consider
the number and importance of the economic palms of other tropical
countries.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally, it may be well to note here that several palms have
been reported from Puerto Rico which probably do not exist in the
island; at least their occurrence is not supported by adequate evidence.
Thus Mr. R. T. Hill, of the United States Geological
Survey, mentions (Bull. U. S. Dept. Agric., Division of Forestry, 25:
1899) as occurring in Puerto Rico seven palms, as follows: <i>Cocos
Mauritia</i>, <i>Oreodoxa oleracea</i>, <i>Cocos nucifera</i>, <i>Martinezia caryotaefolia</i>,
<i>Mauritia flexuosa</i>, <i>Oreodoxa regia</i>, and <i>Caryota</i> sp., of which
list only <i>Cocos nucifera</i> and <i>Oreodoxa regia</i> appear to have been
justified.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reference to <i>Oreodoxa oleracea</i> is supported by the botanical
authority of Professor Drude, but the specimens identified by
him as <i>Oreodoxa oleracea</i> (Sintenis collection, no. 1525) and sent
from the Berlin Botanical Garden to the National Herbarium and
to the New York Botanical Garden are not <i>Oreodoxa oleracea</i>,
but belong to the new genus <i>Acrista</i> described below, while a
specimen collected by Sintenis (no. 5749) at Aguadilla and sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>out from Berlin as an <i>Attalea</i> or related genus is not even a cocoid
palm but <i>Areca catechu</i>, the betel nut of the Malay region.</p>

<p class='c009'>The existence of numerous tubercles on the roots of a young
specimen of the royal palm of Puerto Rico is a fact of biological interest
and possible economic importance. It was, however, noted so
nearly at the end of our last visit that further studies were not
practicable, but barring possible nematodes or other pathological
causes for the tubercles it appears that we must add palms to
the Leguminosae, <i>Podocarpus</i>, <i>Alnus</i>, and <i>Cycas</i> as plants which
have, as it were, domesticated nitrogen-collecting soil organisms.</p>

<p class='c009'>The field notes, specimens and a considerable series of illustrations
for publications of the Department of Agriculture were secured
during two visits to Puerto Rico, the first in November and
December, 1899, the second in June and July, 1901. The photographs
are the work of Mr. G. N. Collins.</p>

<p class='c013'>Leaves feather-shaped; spathes few, not subtending the branches of the inflorescence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Leaf-divisions v-shaped in section, concave above; trunk rough with leaf-bases or
prominent diamond shaped scars.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Leaf-divisions inverted v-shaped in section, convex above; trunk smooth or the
leaf-scars ring-like and not prominent.</p>

<p class='c014'>Leaf-bases long-sheathing, green and fleshy, finally split down the side opposite

      <div class='line'>Family <span class='sc'>Arecaceae</span>, p. <a href='#Page_546'>546</a>.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>Family PHOENICACEAE</h3>

<p class='c016'>This family contains a single genus of old-world palms usually
associated with the fan-leaved series, and differing from all other
feather-palms by having the concave side of the leaf segments
turned upward.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Phoenix dactylifera</span> Linn. Sp. Pl. 1188. 1753</h3>

<p class='c016'>The date palm was probably introduced into Puerto Rico in
the early part of the Spanish occupation of the island, and isolated
trees are to be found in many localities especially in the vicinity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>the larger towns. The climate is, however, too cool and too moist
to permit the fruit to ripen properly, and there is apparently no
inducement for planting in large quantities.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Family SABALACEAE</h3>

<p class='c016'>Although forming no conspicuous part of the palm vegetation
of the island the fan-leaved species seem to be more numerous
than those of any other family. It is certain also that further species
remain to be discovered, since in addition to the species listed below,
young inflorescences supposed to belong to a <i>Copernicia</i> were
collected by Sintenis (no. 6512) near Utuado, and he also collected
two other <i>Thrinax</i>-like palms of doubtful identity, one near
Cabo Rojo and one at Fajardo.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>Key to the Genera of Sabalaceae</h4>

<p class='c011'>Leaves depressed in the middle, with a distinct decurved midrib; a slender fiber rising
from each of the notches which separate the leaf segments.</p>

<p class='c013'>Leaves flat, midrib rudimentary; segment without alternating fibers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Leaves chartaceous, naked on both sides when mature, the veinules unequal; fruits
nearly sessile; seeds smooth, albumen solid except for a deep basal cavity.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Inodes</strong> gen. nov.</h4>

<p class='c016'>In this genus, of which the hat palm of Puerto Rico may be considered
the type, it is proposed to accommodate the dendroid
palms commonly referred to <i>Sabal</i>, the type of which is <i>S. Adansonii</i>
Guersent. The most conspicuous difference between <i>Inodes</i>
and <i>Sabal</i> is, of course, the fact that the former produces an
upright trunk while the latter has only what might be called an
underground rootstock, although such a distinction is quite artificial,
both groups of species beginning life with a creeping axis
which becomes erect in one and remains horizontal in the other.
A much more important difference is to be found in the leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>which in <i>Inodes</i> have secured strength by the development of a
midrib, a tendency early abandoned by <i>Sabal</i> in which the midrib
is rudimentary and the middle of the leaf is the weakest part. The
leaves of <i>Sabal</i> are adapted for standing erect and avoid resistance
to the wind by being split down the middle. The leaves of <i>Inodes</i>
which are held horizontal from an erect axis have attained the
unique adaptation of a decurved midrib which braces the sloping
sides of the leaf and effectively prevents the breaking above the
ligule common in some of the species of <i>Thrinax</i>. It is true that
leaves of young specimens of <i>Inodes</i> stand erect like those of <i>Sabal</i>
and do not have the curved midrib, but even at this stage the midrib
is relatively well developed and the blade opens out to an
almost circular form instead of occupying an arc of 180 degrees
or less as in the more strictly flabellate leaves of <i>Sabal</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Further differential characters might be enumerated, such as the
short ligule and the flat petiole of <i>Sabal</i>. The inflorescence and
seeds also afford differences, but these points are unnecessary for
diagnosis, and their proper expression will require careful comparative
study of the species of both genera, since <i>Sabal</i> is not
monotypic but includes at least two species from the Southern
States and perhaps <i>S. Mexicana</i> Martius. Guersent’s <i>S. Adansonii</i>,
the first binomial species to which the name <i>Sabal</i> was applied,
is, to judge from the figure, the smaller of our species, while
Jacquin’s <i>Corypha minor</i> may be the larger. Both species were
described from hothouse specimens and the plates give no details
really adequate for identification, but if there are but two
species to be considered there can be little doubt that Jacquin’s
drawing represents the larger of the two forms commonly referred
to <i>Sabal Adansonii</i>, since the leaves are nearly four feet long with
the mesial divisions united somewhat less than half way up. The
basal segments are represented, however, as diverging horizontally
and not obliquely as is usual in the living plants in the greenhouses
of the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p class='c009'>Guersent maintained that he was dealing with the <i>Sabal</i> which
Adanson had in mind in naming the genus, and made his specific
name in accordance with that fact, treating <i>Corypha minor</i> Jacquin,
<i>Corypha pumila</i> Walter and <i>Chamaerops acaulis</i> Michaux as synonyms.
The relative merits of these names and of <i>Chamaerops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>glabra</i> Miller, which Dr. Sargent (Silva, <strong>10</strong>: 38) has resurrected,
are not likely to be easy of determination, but since the last was
based on plants grown from seeds which came from Jamaica, it
seems unwise to use it for United States species to which the description
is inapplicable. Miller’s name may, however, replace
<i>Sabal taurina</i> Loddiges which was also founded on a stemless <i>Sabal</i>
supposed to come from Jamaica.</p>

<p class='c009'>The species of <i>Inodes</i> are in a similar or even worse state of
disorder. There is little use, for example, in transferring to the
new genus the traditional name <i>umbraculifera</i> which was based by
Martius on the <i>Corypha umbraculifera</i> of Jacquin, but not on Linnaeus’
species of the same name, which is a native of Ceylon.
Present taxonomic methods forbid such generic transfers of misapplied
names, so that the name <strong>Inodes Blackburniana</strong> (<i>Sabal
Blackburniana</i> Glazebrook, Gardener’s Mag. <strong>5</strong>: 52. 1829) should
be used instead of the traditional <i>Sabal umbraculifera</i> of the conservatories,
though the identity and origin of the species still remain
in doubt.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Inodes causiarum</strong> sp. nov.</h4>

<p class='c020'>Trunk 45–75 cm. thick at base, 5–15 m. tall, columnar or
slightly tapering upward; surface narrowly rimose or nearly
smooth, light gray or nearly white. Leaf-bases splitting into rather
brittle fibers, partly remaining compacted into long ribbons 5–8
cm. wide. Leaves about 4 m. long, the petiole subequal to the
blade, considerably exceeded in length by the inflorescence. Petiole
3.8 cm. wide, distinctly carinate above near the end; ligule 4.2
cm. in diameter. Fruit grayish, 9–10 mm. in diameter; seed
chestnut-brown, finely rugose or nearly smooth, 7–8 mm. in diameter;
embryo oblique, at an angle of somewhat less than 45
degrees from the horizontal. Type specimen from Joyua (no.
154).</p>

<p class='c009'>The palm-leaf hats manufactured in large quantities in Puerto
Rico are made from the present species. The center of the hat
industry is at Joyua, a small village on the western coast of the island
some miles southwest of Mayaguez and west of Cabo Rojo.
Here many hundreds of the palms are growing along the shore in
a narrow belt of coral sand.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the two species of <i>Sabal</i> recognized by Grisebach <i>Inodes
causiarum</i> differs from <i>umbraculifera</i> in having the inflorescence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>much longer than the leaves, while the trunk and leaves are much
shorter and thicker than in <i>Sabal mauritiiformis</i> a native of Trinidad
and Venezuela which appears from Karsten’s figure, reproduced
in the Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien, to have neither the leaves
nor the habit of an <i>Inodes</i> though there is no other genus to
which it can be referred with greater propriety. The diameter of
the trunk of the Trinidad palm described as <i>S. mauritiiformis</i> is
given as from 12 to 15 inches, while <i>I. causiarum</i> is often two feet
or more thick.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Florida palmetto, <strong>Inodes Palmetto</strong> (<i>Corypha Palmetto</i>
Walter, Fl. Carol. 119. 1788) the Puerto Rico species differs
most conspicuously in not retaining the old leaf-bases which give
the trunk of the Florida palm so rough an appearance. The
cause of this difference is doubtless to be found in the fact that
as with most other palms the trunk of <i>I. Palmetto</i> grows to full
size while the surrounding leaf-bases are still alive, but in
the West Indian species the trunk tapers greatly, especially in
young trees, and the leaf-bases are torn away by its gradual enlargement
to full diameter. The existence in southern Florida of
an <i>Inodes</i> having this last characteristic is a fact of much interest
recently brought to my attention by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, of the U.
S. Department of Agriculture. The specific distinctness of this
palm was impressed upon Mr. Schwarz, not only by its naked
trunk, different habit, and smaller size (5 m., instead of 10 to 20 m.),
but also by the possession of a distinctly tropical insect fauna,
quite different from that of the more northern palmetto with which
he had previously been familiar.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This new Florida species it gives me pleasure to name <strong>Inodes
Schwarzii</strong> in honor of its discoverer, in whose opinion of its distinctness
I have great confidence, although he makes no claims
to botanical skill. It is confined, as far as observed by Mr.
Schwarz, to the coral reef formation of southern Florida, the
most accessible station visited being about one mile south of Cocoanut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>Grove on the coral reef of the mainland side of Biscayne
Bay. In the vicinity of Snapper Creek, <i>Inodes Schwarzii</i> extends
to the Everglades where it is met by <i>I. Palmetto</i>. It was also
seen on the Perrine Grant about six miles from Cocoanut Grove;
it seemed not to occur about Miami but reappeared with the appropriate
formation and attendant fauna at New River, though
again absent at Lake Worth. A photograph secured by Mr. H.
J. Webber (negative 164) on Taby Island near Long Key shows
an <i>Inodes</i> with a naked trunk and a smaller crown of straighter
leaves than are normal for <i>I. palmetto</i>. Messrs. Swingle and
Webber had also remarked the distinctness of the smooth-trunked
palmetto of South Florida.</p>

<p class='c009'>A third robust species of <i>Inodes</i> is growing in the conservatory
of the Department of Agriculture labeled <i>Sabal umbraculifera</i>.
It differs conspicuously from <i>I. causiarum</i> by the very large leaves
and by the great development of fine brown fibers which fill all
the interstices between the leaf-bases, and suggest the name <strong>Inodes
vestita</strong>.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Photographs of both the species have been prepared for
the illustration of comparative detailed descriptions.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Sabal Mexicana</i> has been reported from Cuba, and as it is described
in Sargent’s Silva (<strong>10</strong>: 43) as having a trunk “often 2½
feet in diameter,” a robustness equalled only by the Puerto Rico
trees, the question of its identity was examined. It appears that
the original of <i>S. Mexicana</i> came from southern Mexico and is a
trunkless or very slender, rather than a robust species, being only
about 10 cm. in diameter. The berry and the seed are described
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>as closely similar to those of <i>Sabal Adansoni</i>. Sargent’s
<i>S. Mexicana</i> from southern Texas, in addition to the seven times
greater thickness of the trunk, has a seed nearly 1.25 cm. broad
with a strongly prominent micropyle. There can be little doubt
that it is another new species, quite distinct from that of Puerto
Rico, similar only in the unusual diameter of the trunk, which is
furthermore described as bright reddish brown instead of white or
very light grayish as <i>Inodes causiarum</i>. In the view of the apparently
localized distribution of the species of this genus the
name <strong>Inodes Texana</strong> would be appropriate for that described and
figured by Sargent as noted above.</p>

<p class='c009'>In addition to the recently described <strong>Inodes Uresana</strong> (<i>Sabal
Uresana</i> Trelease, Rep. Mo. Bot. Gard. <strong>12</strong>: 79), there is another
large-seeded <i>Inodes</i> on the western slope of Mexico, a specimen of
which was collected at Acaponeta, State of Tepic (no. 1528)
by Dr. J. N. Rose,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> for whom this species may be named <strong>Inodes
Rosei</strong>. The seeds are of the same size and shape as those of <i>I.
Uresana</i>, but have the surface much more finely rugose, or nearly
smooth, with the embryo directly lateral, not subdorsal. The
branches of the inflorescence are slender and but little over 1 mm.
in diameter instead of fusiform and thickened in the middle to
nearly 3 mm. as shown in Professor Trelease’s photographic illustration.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THRINAX Linn. f.; Swartz, Prod. Veg. Ind. Occ. 51. 1788</h4>

<p class='c016'>In the genus <i>Thrinax</i> were formerly placed all the West Indian
fan-palms with smooth stems and no midribs, but the gradual discovery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>of numerous and diverse species has resulted in propositions
for subdivision and segregation on the part of several botanists.
As usual these new groups have been characterized very inadequately,
and that mostly from the flowers and seeds, and with
no attempt at establishing correlations of habit or other vegetative
features without which the classification is likely to remain formal
and artificial, as well as useless for popular and field study. Possibly
no ecological differences exist among the <i>Thrinax</i>-like palms
of other regions, but in Puerto Rico there are, as shown in the discussion
of the following genus, two well-defined types, one of
which varies the ordinary short columnar habit by the possession
of a tall slender and flexible trunk which doubtless enables it to
compete in a measure with the rapid growth of the surrounding
vegetation, and which is also obviously adapted for withstanding
the force of the strong winds encountered in the exposed places
apparently preferred by palms of this species.</p>

<p class='c009'>The type of the genus <i>Thrinax</i> is the Jamaican <i>T. parviflora</i>, a
tree 3 to 6 metres high with the trunk swollen at base. The leaves
are said to be 30–60 cm. long with rigid lanceolate divisions;
the stipes longer than the leaves, terete-compressed. The spadix
is said to be terminal, nearly erect and 60–90 cm. long. The
tree grows in dry maritime situations in Jamaica and Santo
Domingo. It does not appear that the original specimens of this
species have been examined by Sargent or other recent writers,
but it seems reasonable to use the name for the group of short
species with uniform albumen and a basal cavity instead of a complete
perforation. Swartz’s statement regarding the seed “<i>intus
albus, medio ruber</i>,” in connection with its context “<i>nauco osseo
fragile tectus</i>” might possibly be rendered “white inside, red between”
and might refer to the red coat of the seed rather than to
a red center as commonly inferred. Of course Swartz might have
cut his seed transversely, but if so he would doubtless have discovered
and noted the perforation had one existed. Patrick
Brown’s account of the Jamaica species, cited by Swartz, evidently
refers to a palm with the habits of <i>T. Ponceana</i>. On the other hand
the “very slender” palm referred to under this name in the Jamaica
Bulletin (<strong>I</strong>: 196. 1894) shows greater similarity with <i>Thrincoma</i>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><strong>Thrinax praeceps</strong> sp. nov.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Trunk 8–12 cm. in diameter at base, columnar or slightly enlarged
upward, seldom attaining over 3 or 4 meters in height.
The leaf-bases split in the middle of the midrib and long remain
adherent to the trunk. When they finally fall away on older
trees a rather rough grayish and longitudinally chinked rimose
surface is exposed.</p>

<p class='c021'>The stalks of large leaves measure 75–80 cm. in length and
1.2–1.5 cm. in width. The middle divisions of the leaf are 55 cm.
and under in length and attain a width of 4.8 cm., and in the middle
of large leaves are united for more than half their length.
Cross-veinules numerous, distinct in both surfaces but especially the
upper. The white pubescence or tomentum which clothes the young
leaves and is especially abundant on the ligule soon disappears,
leaving the under side glaucous or slightly pruinose.</p>

<p class='c009'>This species is described at some length a little later in a
comparison of generic characters under <i>Thrincoma alta</i>. The type
specimen (no. 850) was collected on the precipitous mountain-side
which overhangs the road between Utuado and Arecibo, a short
distance to the northward from the station where <i>Thrincoma alta</i>
was obtained.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is believed to be the same species was collected in a
similar situation on the side of a mountain overlooking the town
and valley of Lares.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Thrinax Ponceana</strong> sp. nov. <a href='#pl_43'>Plate 43</a></h4>

<p class='c020'>Trunk 5–8 cm. or more in diameter, columnar, or slightly
tapering or enlarged upward, 1–4 m. high; surface coarsely and
irregularly rimose longitudinally. Leaf-bases separating into
abundant rather loose light grayish or brownish fibers. Leaves
numerous, large, drooping or pendant; petioles 65 mm. long,
1.5–2 cm. wide; segments attaining 75 cm. in length and 3.5 cm.
in width, united for half their length. Seed smooth, mahogany-brown,
5 mm. in diameter. Type specimen no. 1005.</p>

<p class='c009'>This species apparently exists in much larger quantities than
any other yet known from Puerto Rico, being the predominant
plant on several square miles of territory along the range of dry
limestone hills which skirt the southern coast of the island, to the
west of Ponce. Many of the palms are scattered among the taller
shrubs and trees wherever there is sufficient soil and water to permit
these to grow and yet not enough to give them exclusive possession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>but on many of the drier and more sterile higher slopes
the advantage is with the palms.</p>

<p class='c009'>This abundance of living material deserves more careful
study than could be given during a very brief visit to this almost
uninhabited part of the island, but one note of systematic
interest was made. Several species of <i>Thrinax</i>, of which <i>T. Morrisii</i>
Wendland may serve as an example, have been described
chiefly with reference to the relative size of the leaf segments and
the extent of their separation. If the palms under observation
near Ponce belonged, as was believed, all to one species, it is not
only true that the individual <i>Thrinax</i> passes all the stages from
the narrow and grass-like, almost completely separated segments
of the very young plant, to the more than half united leaf of the
large tree, but it also appears to be true that under unfavorable
conditions a <i>Thrinax</i> may not be able to attain to full maturity of
size and form but may at the same time produce flowers and seeds.
In the narrow chinks and crevices of the bare rocks were very
small, stunted trees, obviously of great age, while but a few feet
distant a deeper fissure might hold vegetable débris and moisture
sufficient to nourish vigorous specimens several times the size of
their less fortunate companions. The stunted trees retain in proportion
to their size, but apparently with little reference to their
age, the small deeply divided leaves of young plants and have
short few-branched inflorescences, another difference of supposed
systematic importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In <i>Thrinax Ponceana</i> the leaves of well grown trees have the
middle divisions united to about the middle; the smaller the leaves,
the more deeply they are divided. A further correlation with size
is that of the “fullness” of the leaf. The basal sinus is not closed
by the overlapping of the lateral divisions as in some species, but
the area is too great for a plane circle and there are one or more
folds, more numerous and deeper in large leaves. The lateral
divisions do not lie in the plane of the others but project upward
or backward nearly at right angles with the plane of the middle
divisions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The middle divisions of large leaves may measure 75 cm. in
length by 3.5 and sometimes nearly 4 cm. in width, while the narrowly
grass-like lateral segment is only .8 cm. wide and about 30
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>cm. long. The lowest segment is not divided at the tip but is produced
into a slender hair-like seta, 6 or 8 cm. long, making it nearly
as long or longer than the next segment above.</p>

<p class='c009'>The normal segments are split at the apex to the distance of
from 2 to 8 cm. and the tips are usually markedly divaricate,
owing to the fact that the young leaves of this species suffer two
impressions from the bases of older leaves, one near the middle,
the other near the end. The pressure causes the curvature of the
unopened leaves, which in turn causes them to split apart when
the leaf expands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old leaves are smooth and glaucous on the lower side, but in
the younger state more or less remains of the delicate appressed
hairiness present on the lower surfaces of the newly opened leaves.
The lower surface is distinctly grayish and glaucous, but under a
lens it can be seen that this appearance is due to the presence of
numerous whitish points (stomata?) among which are scattering
brownish spots of larger size, the nature of which remains a question.</p>

<p class='c009'>The free stalks of the largest leaves attain 65 cm. in length
and are 2 cm. wide near the base, 1.5 cm. near the apex. The
cross section is lenticular above, but the upper surface becomes
flat toward the base.</p>

<p class='c009'>Young unopened leaves are covered near the base, both above
and below, with a scurfy white tomentum and the margin of the
ligule has a long white fringe.</p>

<p class='c009'>To avoid possible error it seems best to make separate entry
of the following notes on specimens which might be considered
quite distinct from the larger and normally mature form of <i>Ponceana</i>,
but which represent, it is believed, merely a somewhat depauperate
condition of that species, although leaves exactly comparable
were not brought home by our party. The specimens in question
were collected by Sintenis (no. 3500) on the south coast of the
island near Guanica and distributed from Berlin as “<i>Thrinax</i>
n. sp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The leaves are characterized by the narrow straight-sided segments
which retain the same width (15 mm. or less) for about 11
cm.; they are united in the middle of the leaf for about 8 cm. and
the apical tapering part is about the same length. Other species,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>so far as known, have the segments much broader, both absolutely
and relatively, and the width is held for a very much smaller proportion
of the length.</p>

<p class='c009'>In addition the midrib is unusually weak, inconspicuous and
only slightly prominent on the lower side. The small fibro-vascular
bundles which compose it are sometimes spread apart so that
there is scarcely an indication of a rib while in other segments of
the same leaf, and especially at the base, the conditions are more
normal. The midrib is sufficiently distinct above, though very
small and fine in comparison with other species.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lower surface of leaf glabrous or somewhat glaucous, very
slightly puberulous on the depressed veins near the base. Veinlets
inconspicuous, mostly subequal, though 4 or 5 are sometimes
a little larger than the others. Transverse veinlets indistinct below.</p>

<p class='c009'>Petiole slender, 4 mm. wide, lenticular in cross section; about
2 mm. thick. Ligule small and weak, short, with a small apical
mucro.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fruits 5 mm. in diameter, olive brown, irregularly rugose-coriaceous
on the outside as though dried from a pulpy condition;
exocarp with a slightly sweetish taste. Seed bright mahogany-brown,
darker below, depressed-globose, with a sublateral raphe;
embryo ascending but more nearly lateral than vertical; conical
basal cavity extending somewhat above the center, nearly filled
with a deep red material.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the time of our visit in July no ripe fruits of <i>T. Ponceana</i>
were found on the trees, but a few picked up from the ground are
apparently indistinguishable from those of Sintenis’ specimen.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Thrincoma</strong> gen. nov.</h4>

<p class='c020'>Trunk slender, tapering, flexible; wood firm, covered by a
smooth hard brittle outer shell or bark.</p>

<p class='c021'>Leaf-bases long-sheathing, expanded by the separation of the
fibers of the side opposite the midrib; petiole strongly flattened
above the base, prominently angled above and below; ligule large
and firm, produced laterally to support the outer divisions.</p>

<p class='c021'>Leaf-divisions narrow, separated below the middle and below
the point of greatest width; texture firm and coriaceous; veinules
subequal, close together, cross-veinules obsolete. Lower surface
clothed with persistent closely appressed hairs, the upper coated
with wax when young.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>Seeds with few longitudinal grooves, the surface not polished,
grayish; embryo subapical.</p>

<p class='c009'>The generic name alludes to the preference of this palm for the
summits of crags and the brows of perpendicular cliffs which abound
in the limestone region of the north side of Puerto Rico.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tall, slender trunk and other differences between this genus
and <i>Thrinax</i> are probably to be interpreted as ecological adaptations
necessary to enable the present palm to compete with the
vegetation which often surrounds its base, and to withstand the
winds to which it is commonly exposed. The species of <i>Thrinax</i>
and other allied genera, as far as known, have the trunk rigid and
columnar, or even enlarged from the base upwards. When growing
solitary and exposed they seldom, if ever, attain half the height
of <i>Thrincoma</i>. Usually, however, they are protected by other
vegetation or by growing gregariously in thickets.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Thrincoma</i> might be described as a <i>Thrinax</i> which has adopted
habits of the arecoid genus <i>Acria</i> which grows in similar situations
in a neighboring part of the island. In addition to the smooth,
slender, and flexible trunk <i>Thrincoma</i> makes further provision
against the wind in having fewer, less ample, tougher and more
deeply divided leaves and like the arecoid palms it also drops the
old leaves as soon as their usefulness is past, instead of retaining,
like <i>Thrinax</i>, a large pendant cluster of them. The details of these
differences are given below in a comparative note on fresh material
of <i>Thrincoma alta</i> and <i>Thrinax praeceps</i> collected but a short distance
apart in the lower part of the Arecibo valley along the
Utuado-Arecibo road. In this region of jagged mountains, <i>Thrinax</i>
seeks shelter against the walls of perpendicular precipices, while
<i>Thrincoma</i> challenges the wind and the admiration of the traveller
by its evident preference for the crags and pinnacles.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Thrincoma alta</strong> sp. nov.</h4>

<p class='c016'>With but one species known with certainty to belong to the
present genus the separation of generic and specific characters
would have little purpose. Data for a specific description are,
however, contained in the following notes which are retained in
their original comparative form as better illustrating the generic
differentiation of <i>Thrincoma</i> and <i>Thrinax</i>, as represented by
<i>Thrinax praeceps</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>The trunk of <i>Thrincoma</i> differs in three adaptive particulars
from that of <i>Thrinax praeceps</i>, <i>Ponceana</i> and similar species which
are merely columnar with very short internodes and an irregularly
rimose surface, not smooth and hardened.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. There are distinct internodes from 3.5 to 5 cm. in length.
These indicate rapid growth and would increase the chances of survival
in the face of competition of quick-growing tropical vegetation.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The trunk tapers gradually from a diameter of 9 cm. near
the base to 3.5 at the top, and thus possesses considerable flexibility
in view of its great length, 11 meters, <i>Thrinax praeceps</i> and other
related types not exceeding 4 or 5 meters.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. In order to support the weight and strain of this greater
height, the texture of the wood is extremely hard and firm, especially
near the base of the trunk. Externally it is covered by a
smooth shell or bark of very hard, brittle, dark colored material.
The fibers of the interior which in <i>Thrinax</i> are merely imbedded
in a soft pith like those of a corn-stalk are here thickened and
cemented together, as in tall palms of other groups, into a dense
hard wood. In the specimen cut by us all but a small area of the
middle of the trunk was thus hardened, rendering it extremely
heavy. The wood-fibers of <i>Thrincoma</i> are much coarser than
those of <i>Thrinax</i>, and there appear to be none of the obliquely
radial threads which are abundant in the wood of <i>Thrinax Ponceana</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>With reference to methods of leaf-attachment four differences
may be noted:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. In <i>Thrinax praeceps</i> the leaf-bases split below in the median
line and remain long attached to the trunk. This adaptation is not
confined to the old leaves but appears while the leaves are still very
young, or as soon as they begin to be expanded by the pressure
of those above them. In the tall species such pressure separates
the fibers of the opposite side of the cylinder. The short species
has the outside of the leaf-bases densely tomentose, and the tomentum
is especially abundant along the edges of the split midrib of
the young leaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The ligule of <i>Thrincoma</i> is notably larger than that of
<i>Thrinax</i> and continues to lie in the same plane as the blade, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>becomes brown with maturity. In old leaves of <i>Thrinax</i> the ligule
stands nearly at a right angle to the blade and remains green.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. For leaves of the same size the petioles, not including the
sheathing base, are longer (75–80 cm.) in the short than in the tall
species (60–65 cm.).</p>

<p class='c009'>The petiole of the short species is of nearly the same width
(1.2–1.5 cm.) throughout, while in the other it is distinctly broader
at both ends than in the middle. The enlargement at the ligule is
abrupt. The base widens gradually to about 2 cm. but is much
thinner than in the short species. In the upper part of the petiole
the reverse is true, the cross section of the leaf-stalk of the <i>Thrincoma</i>
being almost diamond-shape, while that of <i>Thrinax</i> is merely
lenticular.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. These differences of proportion of ligule and stalk are obviously
correlated with the different habits of the two species. The
shorter and more robust trunk of the one enables it to withstand
the strain of the relatively limited exposure to the wind. There is
also a greater flexibility in the leaf itself, due to its thinner texture
and to the smaller development of the ligule and adjacent thickened
area, so that the leaves are often split to near the center. The
narrow petiole of the tall species affords greater flexibility in the
lateral plane while strength has been secured by the greater thickness.
On the other hand the thinness of the base of the petiole
of <i>Thrincoma</i> reduces resistance by permitting the petiole to be
twisted when the leaf is opposed to the wind or blown laterally,
thus avoiding the strain which would come upon the more rigid
base of the petiole in <i>Thrinax</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The more salient differences between the leaf-blades of the two
species may be enumerated as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Although the length of the middle segments of the leaves
of <i>Thrincoma</i> are longer (62 cm.) than those of the other (55 cm.)
the apparent size of the latter is much greater because they are
fully expanded while those of <i>Thrincoma</i> remain more or less fan-shaped,
generally opening less than a semicircle. This decreases
the lateral expansion, since the shortest divisions are brought to
the sides, and gives no projection below the ligule where in
<i>Thrinax</i> more than one third of the foliar expanse is located.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The leaf segments are much narrower (3.6 cm.) in the tall
than in the short species (4.8 cm.).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>3. Practically the difference in width is still greater because the
segments of <i>Thrincoma</i> are never fully expanded but remain deeply
channelled, thus decreasing the area of exposure to the wind and
increasing the rigidity of the leaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Resistance to the wind is also reduced in the tall species by
the separation of all the segments to more than two-thirds their
length, while in <i>Thrinax praeceps</i> the median segments are united
more than half way up. In the latter, as in the other members of
the group, the separation begins at the point of greatest width of
the segment, but as if to show that the deeply divided leaves of
<i>Thrincoma</i> are an adaptation, the greatest width is located near the
longitudinal middle of the segments, 10 cm. or more above the
bottom of the cleft.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The texture of the leaf of <i>Thrincoma</i> is thicker and firmer
so that the segments generally remain straight to the tips while
in <i>Thrinax</i> they often droop after the leaves have become fully expanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The color of the leaves of the tall palm is a very dark green
while those of <i>Thrinax praeceps</i> are uniformly of a much lighter,
fresher tint.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. The veinules of the firm leaves of <i>Thrincoma</i> are more
numerous and closer together than those of <i>Thrinax</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. The veinules are also subequal in size, giving an appearance
of uniform pattern, while in <i>Thrinax praeceps</i> from 3 to 5 of
the veinules of each side of the midrib are distinctly larger than
the others, the larger veinlets being separated by from 3 to 10
smaller ones.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. In <i>Thrincoma</i> the cross-veinules are scarcely visible to the
naked eye; under a lens they are still obscure, never equalling in
size the smaller of the longitudinal veinules, which they seldom
appear to cross. In <i>Thrinax praeceps</i>, on the contrary, the cross-veinules
are as large as the finer longitudinal ones; they are obvious
without a lens and give the fabric of the leaf a peculiar marbled
effect on account of the fact that they are generally oblique or
wavy and commonly appear to cross several of the longitudinal
veinules.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. The margins of the segments are thickened in both
species, and on the upper side there is a groove inside the marginal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>rib. In the short species the margin is flat below and does
not become decurved in drying. In the other the thin edge is
closely folded under, and on drying the sides of the segments uniformly
roll under, giving the dried leaves of the two species an
appearance even more dissimilar than in the fresh state.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. The lower surface of the leaf of <i>Thrincoma</i> has a silvery
white layer of fine closely appressed hairs, all lying parallel to the
veins and forming a continuous covering. The fibers seem not to
be attached merely at one end, but along the side. They are firmly
adherent and are to be removed only by scraping or rubbing; the
surface underneath is deep green like the upper side, but the fibers
remain in the grooves between the veins. In <i>Thrinax praeceps</i> the
lower surface of mature leaves is smooth and glaucous, a comparatively
very slight hairy covering present in young leaves being
evanescent, though traces of it are usually to be found in the deeper
basal grooves. The glaucous appearance is due to the presence
of numerous white or hyaline points arranged in rows (stomata?).
The hairiness of one leaf and the glaucous character of the other
are probably to be looked upon as different adaptations for the
same purpose—the reduction of transpiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>12. The upper surface and the ligule of young leaves of <i>Thrincoma</i>
are covered with a layer of wax in the form of small plates
or scales not present in <i>Thrinax</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Thringis</strong> gen. nov.</h4>

<p class='c020'>Trunk columnar, rimose; wood pithy. Leaves coriaceous
with equal veinules, silvery below with closely appressed whitish
pubescence. Fruits distinctly pedicellate, the pedicel with a bract
above the base. Seed cerebriform, irregular, with wide furrows
and convolutions; surface smooth and shining. Embryo subapical.</p>

<p class='c009'>The characters of this genus are imperfectly known, none of
the specimens being complete. Supposing however, that the association
is a natural one, we have a genus with leaves and pedicellate
fruits much more similar to those of <i>Thrincoma</i> than to
those of <i>Thrinax</i>, and at the same time a columnar, rimose and
pithy trunk like that of <i>Thrinax</i> and <i>Coccothrinax</i>. The seeds
appear to differ from those of all related genera in the possession
of large irregular convolutions. The coriaceous leaves, small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>fruits, subapical embryo, and other differences separate this genus
from <i>Coccothrinax</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Thringis laxa</strong> sp. nov.</h4>

<p class='c020'>The trunk is columnar or somewhat enlarged upward, about
3.6 m. high and 12 cm. in diameter. Surrounding its base was
a dense turf of fine upright rootlets. The bark was rough and
rimose.</p>

<p class='c021'>The leaves are similar to those of <i>T. latifrons</i>, but smaller, the
segments being about 70 cm. long by 33 mm. wide. The size of
leaves is thus about the same as those of <i>Thrincoma alta</i>, but the
texture is thin and flexible, the veinules being slender and not
prominent on either side. The pubescence is much thinner than
that of <i>T. alta</i> and of a silvery-gray color.</p>

<p class='c009'>A palm collected in December, 1899, at Vega Baja, but without
fruit (no. 1041). The habit and trunk are not those of <i>Thrincoma</i>,
but the form and texture of the leaves and ligule associate the
species with <i>Thrincoma alta</i> rather than with the palms here
placed in <i>Thrinax</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The columnar habit and protected habitat are reflected in the
small ligule, 18 mm. across, and the relatively broad petiole, 13
mm. wide. It appears from the dried specimens of this species
and <i>T. latifrons</i> that the leaves may have been “full,” or irregularly
folded, instead of strictly and equally expanded as in <i>Thrincoma
alta</i>, and the greater width of the segments is a further
indication of this possibility. The rigidity of the leaf of <i>Thrincoma
alta</i> can be maintained because the segments are narrow and do
not open widely.</p>

<p class='c009'>The soft texture of the leaves of this palm is recognized by
the natives who use it for making hats and call it “yaray” the
same name which is applied in this part of the island to <i>Inodes
causiarum</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Thringis latifrons</strong> sp. nov.</h4>

<p class='c016'>The leaves, inflorescence and young plants of a palm collected
by Sintenis (no. 3278) on Monte Calabaza near Coamo are much
larger and coarser than those of <i>Thrincoma alta</i>. The total length
of the middle segments of the leaf would be over a meter, and the
width of the larger divisions is over 5 cm. The thickness of the
petiole at the base of the ligule is over 10 mm. The form of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>ligule is much like that of <i>Thrincoma alta</i>, though scarcely as
large in proportion to the size of the leaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lower surface is clothed with a satiny, appressed grayish
pubescence somewhat less pronounced than that of <i>Thrincoma alta</i>.
As in that species the veinules are of equal size, but they are more
widely separated, and the wavy and usually somewhat oblique
transverse veinules are easily distinguishable on both sides of the
dried leaf. There are also slight traces of wax on the ligule and
in the grooves of the upper surface. The median divisions are
united for distinctly more than one-third their length.</p>

<p class='c009'>The spathes and spadix are distinctly larger than those of
<i>Thrincoma alta</i>, but the fruits are, unfortunately, quite immature
and contain only shriveled seeds. The pedicels of the fruits are
2–4 mm. long and bear, usually near the middle, a very slender
bract 1–2 mm. long.</p>

<p class='c009'>This species is apparently distinct from <i>Thringis laxa</i> in the
larger size and firmer texture of the leaves. It differs in the longer
pedicels of the fruits, with their longer and more slender bracts,
from a specimen belonging to the New York Botanical Garden and
supposed to have been collected by Mr. A. A. Heller, though the
number (3278) indicates that it may belong to the Sintenis series.</p>

<p class='c009'>This consists of a single, short, once-branched inflorescence
arising from two fibrous spathes. The fruits are about 4 mm. in
diameter, nearly spherical, distinctly apiculate, deep reddish brown
in color and borne on pedicels 2–3 mm. long, with a bract 1 mm.
long or less at or below the middle. The seeds are 2–2.5 mm. in
diameter; the surface is smooth and shining and light brown in
color; general shape spherical but with deep folds and convolutions.</p>

<p class='c009'>No leaves are known in connection with this specimen, and the
exact locality is also in doubt. Mr. Heller believes, however,
that the inflorescence came from a small <i>Thrinax</i>-like palm growing
in the limestone hills a few miles to the east of San Juan.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Family ARECACEAE</h3>

<p class='c016'>A large family, with abundant genera in the tropics of America
and Asia, but absent from tropical Africa. The Puerto Rico
representatives may be recognized very easily by the fact that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>leaf crown is supported upon a column of the sheathing bases, a
character of which the royal palm furnishes a conspicuous and
ever-present example. Of the remaining genera, one, the betel
palm of the East Indies is sparingly introduced about towns in the
western part of the island and may be recognized at a glance by
reason of the extremely dark green of its foliage. The other two
genera are native palms confined to uncultivated areas and thus
seldom seen at close range from traveled roads. The mountain
palm, <i>Acrista</i>, covers the summits of many of the mountains of
the island, but <i>Aeria</i> seems to be confined to the range of high
limestone crags which skirt the northern coast of the island between
Bayamon and Arecibo.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>Key to the Genera of Arecaceae</h4>

<p class='c011'>Trunk tall and slender, tapering from a swollen base; spathes numerous (7); inflorescence

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Aeria</strong> gen. nov.</h4>

<p class='c016'>A tall slender palm evidently related to <i>Gaussia</i>, but the embryo
lateral instead of basal, and the pinnae without basal cushions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among palms in Puerto Rico <i>Aeria</i> resembles only <i>Acrista</i>,
from which it is readily distinguishable by the very slender habit,
the swollen base of the trunk, the much-branched slender interfoliar
inflorescence, the shorter sheathing bases of the leaves, and
the numerous spathes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The embryo of <i>Aeria</i> is located near the longitudinal middle
of the seed on the side opposite the rudiment of the style, which
is here located at the base of the fruit instead of on the side as in
<i>Acrista</i>. The albumen is also uniform, except for a small central
cavity and the outer covering is fleshy rather than fibrous.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>The position of the embryo is, perhaps, the most obvious difference
between this genus and <i>Gaussia</i>, but there are several
other significant discrepancies. Thus the flowers are arranged 3
or 4 in a row, very seldom 5 or 6. Three fruits develop from one
flower only exceptionally. The trunk is of more than medium
height, and the inflorescence is in reality infrafoliar, for although
the dead leaf-bases and midribs of the leaves are persistent and
support the long inflorescence, this condition is not comparable to
that of the cocoid and other really interfoliar inflorescences.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Aeria attenuata</strong> sp. nov. <a href='#pl_45'>Plate 45.</a></h4>

<p class='c016'>The tallest of Puerto Rico palms, probably attaining 30 metres
and upward. The trunk is supported on a mass of coarse roots
with spine-like projecting rootlets arranged in whorls. The surface
of the trunk is smooth with very faint annular impressions.
Near the ground the diameter is 12 to 15 cm. and increases upward
to about 25 cm. at about 3 m. above the base. Above
this swelling the trunk tapers very gradually and in tall specimens
is less than 7 cm. in diameter at the top.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sheathing leaf-base is only 20 cm. long. The leaves remain
attached long after the rupture of the open side, but no fibers
are formed, the edges of the split side being fringed only with
brown membranous shreds. The petiole is rather short, round
and rigid and the rachis is prominently angled above.</p>

<p class='c009'>Segments of a rather firm texture and standing in different
planes, but all more or less upright or oblique to the rachis, segments
from middle of leaf 2.3 cm. wide near the base, 3.8 cm.
long. The segments are set very closely together, especially the
proximal, and overlap each other in a succubous manner. Fresh
fruits deep orange in color and of an unsymmetrical oval in shape,
16 mm. by 12 mm., with a firm, fleshy outer covering 1.6 mm. thick,
adherent to the seed, the three persistent styles remain of the
same size and are located at the base of the fruit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The seed is flattened oval, 11 mm. by 9 mm., with a prominent
basal tubercle (hilum). The surface is brownish with a few
shallow impressed lines, but the albumen is white and uniform.
Flowers and ripe fruit were obtained at Vega Baja in December,
1899; type specimen no. 1040.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>The so-called llume palm is a most striking ornament of the
rugged limestone hills from Vega Baja to Manati and Arecibo.
At a sufficient distance the slender trunk is no longer visible
and the crown of leaves appears as if suspended in mid-air, while
at closer range it does not seem possible that so slender a shaft
can maintain itself. This very slenderness with the attending flexibility
is however, an element of strength since it permits the trees
to bend before the wind while the leaves diminish the resistance
by straightening out as in the cocoanut. The hurricane of August,
1899, seemed to have done little damage to these tallest of
Puerto Rico palms, many of which project for more than half
their height above everything standing about them. As the trees
of the rather sparse forest growth of these hills are commonly
from 12 to 18 metres tall, the llume palms must often attain upwards
of 30 metres.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Areca Catechu</span> Linn. Sp. Pl. 1189. 1753</h4>

<p class='c016'>In the western end of the island the betel palm of the Malay
region has been sparingly introduced, though the fact does not
seem to have been reported hitherto. A few were seen in gardens
about Mayaguez and others in and near San Sebastian. So far
as we were able to learn, the people do not know the name or nature
of this introduced species which is apparently planted only as
an ornament or a curiosity. The form is not unpleasing, but the
extremely deep, sombre green of the foliage seems almost unnatural
and imparts a suggestion of artificiality.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only photographs and fruits of <i>Areca</i> were secured at San
Sebastian, but Puerto Rico specimens collected by Sintenis (no
5749) at Aguadilla have already been distributed from the Berlin
Botanical Garden with the label “Palma Spec. Subtrib. Attaleae.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'>ROYSTONEA Cook, Science, II. <strong>12</strong>: 479. 1900</h4>

<p class='c016'><i>Oreodoxa</i> Martius and more recent authors, not Willdenow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The history of the generic name <i>Oreodoxa</i> shows that botanical
writers of the last few decades have been in error in removing the
two original species and applying it to another series of similar but
not closely related forms. To avoid further confusion with reference
to a name which by reason of the conspicuous character of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>the trees has wide use in popular literature it seems desirable to
add the following notes on the genus <i>Oreodoxa</i> as originally established
by Willdenow in the Memoires de l’Academie Royale, Berlin,
1804, a publication which seems to have been consulted very
seldom, even by writers on palms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Spathe universal, univalvate; spadix ramose, perianth monophyllous,
tripartite below, the divisions ovate, acute, concave;
petals ovate, acuminate, concave. Filaments six, of the length of
the corolla; anthers oblong, acute. Style tripartite, shorter than
the filaments, stigma acute. Ovule, drupe, and seed globose;
drupe succulent, but slightly fibrous; seed single, cartilaginous,
nearly smooth, marked with a longitudinal sulcus. In the discussion
subsequent to the statement of the above characters, <i>Oreodoxa</i>
is said to be distinct from <i>Bactris</i> in the tripartite style and in the
absence of the “ordinary three impressions”; it is distinguished
from <i>Areca</i>, then supposed to include <i>Euterpe</i> and species now generally
placed in <i>Oreodoxa</i>, in the single spathe, the triple style and
the hermaphrodite flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first species is <i>Oreodoxa acuminata</i>, referred by recent
authors to <i>Euterpe</i> but probably constituting a distinct genus. The
trunk is erect, cylindrical, very smooth, and attains a height of
from 15 to 18 metres; the “root” throws out suckers at the base
of the trunk. The fronds are pinnate, with opposite or alternate,
very long, ensiform, acuminate pinnae, replicate at base. The
strongly convolute young leaves form a green apex for the trunk,
five feet high. Spathes cinereous, folded in at the base of the
leaf-sheaths at the top of the trunk, univalvate, deciduous; spadix
erect, much branched, having the appearance of a broom.</p>

<p class='c009'>The heart of the bundle of leaf-bases, about two feet long and
three inches thick is eaten as a salad, with oil and vinegar. It is
also stated that the deciduous boat-shaped spathes serve as reservoirs
of rain-water which is long retained in the cool shade cast
by the trees. Birds and beasts, and human natives as well, are
said to be dependent at times upon the liquid thus stored, since in
the regions where the palm grows there are at times no other means
of procuring water. The forests of the high mountain chain of
Buena Vista in the province of Caracas are the native home of the
species. It thus appears that in addition to the structural differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span><i>Oreodoxa acuminata</i> occupies quite a different place in nature
from that of the more thoroughly tropical species commonly
referred to that genus, and the stoloniferous habit also indicates a
different ecology.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second of the original species of <i>Oreodoxa</i> is now referred
to the genus <i>Catoblastus</i>. It is a somewhat smaller tree from 12
to 15 metres high, with a generally similar habit, and is also stoloniferous,
but the pinnae are broad, cuneiform and praemorse, or
irregularly truncate as in the species generally referred to <i>Martinezia</i>.
The drupaceous fruit is grayish and the pulp is only slightly
succulent; seed the size of a pigeon’s egg, its exterior brown,
marbled with numerous veins. In the characters of the spathe
the arrangement of the fruit and the edible quality of the heart of
the leaf-cluster, as well as in the formation of lateral off-shoot this
species is said to be similar to the first.</p>

<p class='c009'>Botanists are not yet agreed upon the methods of dealing with
complications like the present in regard to the names of plants,
but it appears certain that those who do not recognize <i>Oreodoxa</i>
as a genus distinct from those admitted in the more recent works
on palms must associate it either with <i>Euterpe</i> or <i>Catoblastus</i>.
The latter name it would in that case replace, being much older.
Moreover, unless we are prepared to disregard Willdenow’s statements
concerning the stoloniferous trunk, the simple spathe and
the hermaphrodite flowers, to say nothing of many minor points
of circumstantial evidence, there is no scientific warrant for applying
the name <i>Oreodoxa</i> to the noble Antillean species with which
it has been universally associated.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dried specimens which Willdenow studied were supplemented
by notes of field observation by a court gardener, who
was evidently also a botanist of some experience, to whom Willdenow
refers as his “friend.” The living colors are described
with considerable detail throughout the entire paper, which renders
noteworthy the fact that the spathes are stated to be cinereous.
This is in agreement with species of <i>Euterpe</i> which have
membranous spathes, but indicates a wide difference from the
West Indian trees where the spathes are thick and fleshy and remain
vivid green until they open and fall away.</p>

<p class='c009'>The name <i>Roystonea</i> has been given to this ornament of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>Puerto Rico landscape as a respectful compliment to General Roy
Stone, the American engineer officer who secured the admiration
of the people of Puerto Rico by his fearlessness and conspicuous
energy in the Adjuntas road-building campaign which flanked
the line of Spanish defenses, and whose subsequent interest in the
improvement of the island will undoubtedly affect its future history.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Roystonea Borinquena</strong> sp. nov. Plate <i>45. f. 2</i>.</h4>

<p class='c020'>Trunk normally fusiform, 30–60 cm. thick, 12–18 m. high.
Leaf segments 4–4.4 cm. in width. Inflorescence robust, compact,
twice branched, the branches numerous and coarse, ferruginous,
pubescent. Fruits long-oval, yellowish brown at maturity.
Seeds 8 mm. by 6.3 mm., flattened about the hilum, rounded below;
wall of endocarp smooth, adherent over a small area.</p>

<p class='c009'>The royal palm of Puerto Rico differs from that of Cuba in
having the trunk generally shorter, more robust and more distinctly
fusiform. The inflorescence is twice branched, with the
branches more densely clustered, coarser and darker colored than
those of the Cuban royal palm, <i>Roystonea regia</i>. They are also
covered with a slightly hispid brown pubescence while Cuban
specimens are much smoother and more pallid. The difference of
habit, to judge from photographs of the Cuban species, is most
apparent when the trees have grown in the open, as when planted
in avenues or along roadsides. In Puerto Rico, trees which are
obliged to compete with other vegetation are often tall, slender and
unsymmetrical. The typical form is shown in our photograph
(no. 250) taken in the plaza of Juana Diaz.</p>

<p class='c009'>Martius gives the width of the pinnae of the Cuban royal palm
as from 8 to 12 lines. Cuban specimens show as much as one
inch and a quarter, while others from Porto Rico are half an inch
wider (44 mm.) of somewhat coarser texture and with more widely
separated secondary veins. The fruits of the Puerto Rico palm are
a deep yellowish brown when ripe, while those of the Cuban are said
to become violet or bluish black. According to Martius, the fruits
of the Cuban species are 6 lines by 4, but dried specimens show
no such discrepancy of proportions and measure only about 8.5
mm. by 7.5 mm.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Puerto Rico the fresh fruits are also much longer than broad,
perhaps even more slender than the figures given for the Cuban;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>when dry they still appear somewhat longer and larger than the
latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The seeds of <i>Roystonea Borinquena</i> differ in several particulars
from those of the Cuban species. In shape they are longer and
less spherical, measuring 8 by 6.3 by 5.5 mm. instead of 7.8 by
7 by 6 mm.; the side bearing the hilum is much flattened and
even slightly concave; the fibers radiating from the hilum are
longer, and the corner between the hilum and the micropyle is
evenly rounded, not sharply squared and prominent as in <i>R. regia</i>.
On the back of the seed the smooth inner wall of the endocarp is
closely adherent over a small area, while in Cuban seeds this wall
remains attached over nearly the whole side and is furthermore
distinctly rugose-coriaceous on the surface, and has a distinct sulcus
in the median line.</p>

<p class='c009'>The royal palm is not only the more conspicuous and characteristic
natural object in most parts of Puerto Rico, but it probably
exceeds the cocoanut in total economic importance. The most
useful part is the <i>yagua</i> or sheathing base of the leaf, with which
a large proportion of the houses of the poorer classes are thatched
or sided, or both.</p>

<p class='c009'>The royal palm is one of the wild species which has been
distinctly advantaged by human interference in natural conditions.
It is a general fact that outside the climbing species palms are not
successful in competing with tropical forest vegetation. Originally
the royal palm and the corozo were probably confined to the
more rugged slopes of the lower limestone hills where they both
still retain a foothold in places where the natural growth seems
never to have been cleared away. But the vast majority of royal
palms now in existence in Puerto Rico stand on land which has
been cultivated at one time or another, and where the palms were
able to secure a foothold before the competition of other plants
became too strong.</p>

<p class='c009'>The discovery of root tubercles on a young plant of this species
has been noted in the introductory statement. These tubercles
though small in size are very numerous upon the smaller roots.
In shape they are mostly oval and symmetrical. The larger are
about 2 mm. in length though our natural-size photograph shows
several fusiform or clavate bodies from 5 to 10 mm. long and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>much as 2 mm. thick. The color of the roots and tubercles is
white.</p>

<p class='c009'>The royal palm of Florida is commonly referred to <i>Oreodoxa
regia</i>, though with very doubtful propriety. Apparently on account
of its great size, Cooper (Smithsonian Report 1860: 440.
1861) was inclined to identify it with <i>Oreodoxa oleracea</i> which had
also been reported from the Bahamas. The inflorescence and
seeds collected by Curtis on the western borders of the everglades
(no. 2676) are, however, obviously not those of <i>R. oleracea</i> but are
much more similar to those of <i>R. regia</i>. The branches of the inflorescence
are much longer and more lax than those of the species
of Cuba and Puerto Rico, from which they also differ in the frequent
development of tertiary branches, in this respect resembling
<i>Roystonea oleracea</i>. The fruits do not resemble those of <i>R. oleracea</i>
but are closely similar to those of the other species though somewhat
smaller and more nearly spherical. Several reliable witnesses
are on record to the effect that the trees are from 28 to 35 metres
high and as much as 45 metres has been claimed, while among the
royal palms of Cuba and Puerto Rico 18 metres is the commonly
recognized limit of size. Mr. C. T. Simpson, of the U. S. National
Museum, states that the palms of southwestern Florida lack the
conspicuous bulge so characteristic in the trunks of the Puerto
Ricon trees, and that they grow almost in reach of tide-water,
while the natural habitat of the Puerto Rico species is evidently
the limestone hills. In view of these differences it seems preferable
to treat the Florida royal palm as a distinct species, for which
the name <strong>Roystonea Floridana</strong> is proposed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Simpson also informs me that the royal palms seen on the
islands off the coast of Honduras had the size and habit of those
of Florida and not the relatively stunted appearance of those seen
by him in Hayti and Jamaica. This fact is suggestive in connection
with the popular idea that the palms of Florida are to be
looked upon as recent arrivals from Cuba. Instead it seems more
reasonable to believe that the royal palm of Puerto Rico, like the
species of <i>Thrinax</i> of that island, is a remnant of the flora of the
time when the limestone hills were keys and hammocks like those
of southern Florida, and relatively poor in vegetation able to
crowd out the palms.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><strong>Acrista</strong> gen. nov.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Trunk slender, of uniform diameter. Pinnae horizontal, appendiculate.
Inflorescences distinctly infrafoliar; spathes two, the
outer short, the inner long and slender. Spadix once-branched,
the branches coarse, tapering. Fruits with stigma lateral, seed
deeply ruminate, embryo basal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Related to <i>Roystonea</i>, but differing in the more slender habit,
the once-branched inflorescence, the basal embryo, and in having
the leaflets in one plane. The color of the foliage is also considerably
lighter than that of the royal palm so that from a distance
the general appearance suggests the cocoanut rather than the
royal palm.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is also some resemblance between the foliage of <i>Acrista</i>
and <i>Cocops</i>, but the absence of sheathing leaf-bases in the latter
genus will enable even young specimens to be separated. Moreover
the leaf-divisions of <i>Cocops</i> are much narrower and those at
the end of the leaf are not so much shortened as in <i>Acrista</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Further differences from <i>Roystonea</i> are to be found, such as
the much smaller size and the larger roots, which are tuberculate
and inclined to become superficial like those of the llume palm.
The sheathing leaf-bases are not as long proportionately as in
<i>Roystonea</i>, and there is a distinct formation of fibers, although the
texture is flimsy. The outer sheaths do not split off and fall away
as promptly as in <i>Roystonea</i> but several dead ones sometimes hang
from about the base of the crown. Although the sheath is longer
than in <i>Aeria</i> the fibers are much better developed, there being
but a few membranous shreds in <i>Aeria</i>, and no distinct fibers
at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the mountains between Cayey and Guayama many
summits are covered with the <i>palma de sierra</i>, probably in places
which have never been cleared. A few of the palms follow
down the steeper uncultivated ravines. From a distance the
crowns suggest royal palms but a closer view renders the difference
apparent. There is also no suggestion of the bulging trunk of
<i>Roystonea</i>. In height the <i>palma de sierra</i> probably does not exceed
the royal palm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tips of leaflets of young leaves are connected by two brittle
red strands both of which lie on the mesial face, one along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>edge, the other near the middle. The tips of the leaflets are of
the same material and are sometimes persistent as long corneous
appendices like those of the cultivated <i>Howea</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The generic name <i>Euterpe</i> Gaertner, which is commonly applied
to a considerable series of American palms related to the present,
was in reality established for the Malayan genus for which the
name <i>Calyptrocalyx</i> Blume is now in use, <i>Pinanga silvestris globosa</i>
Rumphius being cited by both Gaertner and Blume as the
original, in the one case, of <i>Euterpe globosa</i>, and in the other of
<i>Calyptrocalyx spicatus</i>. The origin and identity of the seed
described and figured by Gaertner have not been established, and
seem likely to remain in doubt; but in describing <i>Calyptrocalyx</i>,
Blume argued that the generic name should remain with the seeds
studied by Gaertner and declared that these did not belong to any
Malayan species but to some of the arecoid palms of the Mascarene
Islands. This suggestion seems not to have been disposed
of by Martius or others, but the fact that Gaertner’s fruits showed
an apical stigma seems to exclude them from the American group
with which the generic name has been associated.</p>

<p class='c009'>In making use of the name <i>Euterpe</i> for Brazilian palms Martius
cites Gaertner as author of the genus and states that it is of worldwide
distribution in the tropics. Gaertner’s <i>E. globosa</i> is placed as
a synonym of <i>E. oleracea</i><a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Martius, and Jacquin’s older name <i>Areca
oleracea</i> stands in the same relation to <i>Euterpe edulis</i> Martius, thus
rendering <i>Euterpe oleracea</i> Martius a specific homonym. Subsequently
Martius claims the genus <i>Euterpe</i> for himself and expresses
doubt whether it is the same as that named by Gaertner, while
Drude in Engler and Prantl’s Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien says
“<i>Euterpe</i> Mart. (nicht Gaertn.).” Martius also admits that the West
Indian <i>Areca oleracea</i> Jacquin is distinct from the Brazilian species
of <i>Euterpe</i>, and redescribes it under the name <i>Oreodoxa oleracea</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>A further complication connected with <i>Acrista</i> was brought to
light by finding that specimens collected by Sintenis (no. 1525) in
the Luquillo Mountains in northeastern Puerto Rico and distributed
from the Berlin Botanical Garden as <i>Oreodoxa oleracea</i> belong to
the present genus, together with others collected in Martinique by
Hahn (no. 805) and identified at Paris. With the last, the local
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>name <i>choux palmiste</i> is given, the same which Jacquin noted in
the original description of his <i>Areca oleracea</i> (Stirp. Am. 278. 1763).
Moreover, it can scarcely be determined from Jacquin’s description
whether he was dealing with a <i>Roystonea</i> or an <i>Acrista</i> or with
both, though his claim that his was the tallest palm of the Antilles
might hold the name for the <i>Roystonea</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It might then be argued by some that Miller’s species, <i>Palma
altissima</i> constituted a segregate from Jacquin’s <i>oleracea</i> and that
the latter name is available for the <i>Acrista</i> of Martinique, whether
identical or not with that of Puerto Rico. But with a possible
doubt between the <i>Acrista</i> and the <i>Roystonea</i> there can scarcely be
a justification for the use of the same name for a third South
American species or a fourth West Indian.</p>

<p class='c009'>As a means of decreasing the confusion it may be suggested
that as neither the generic nor the specific name of the Brazilian
palm which Martius called <i>Euterpe oleracea</i> (Hist. Nat. Palm. 2:
29) is available, the name <strong>Catis Martiana</strong> may be proposed, the
generic designation having reference to the drooping pinnae characteristic
of the present species and several of its South American
relatives.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><strong>Acrista monticola</strong> sp. nov. <a href='#pl_44'>Plate 44.</a></h4>

<p class='c020'>Trunk smooth, 10 to 15 m. high, perhaps taller, from 12 to
15 cm. in diameter, with distinct ring-like leaf-scars and internodes,
light brownish or appearing grayish with bark lichens.</p>

<p class='c021'>Leaves about 2 m. long, the pinnae lanceolate, equally spaced
and lying nearly horizontal, 55 cm. long and 4 cm. broad; the
surface light green on both sides, with very close parallel longitudinal
veinlets, but no visible cross veins. The sheathing bases
are considerably shorter and generally appear somewhat more robust
than in <i>Roystonea</i>. In protected situations the leaf-bases persist
and the margins shrivel up and expose a flimsy network of
fibers. Inflorescences appearing several close together; by the
falling of the leaves above them they are left several inches below
the leaf-bases before maturity is attained. Spathes fusiform, long,
more slender and pointed than in <i>Roystonea</i>. Spadix once-branched,
1 m. long, 6 cm. in diameter at base, tapering gradually to the
apex. Branches 23 cm. long and less, the proximal branches
longest; at first appressed to the rachis, the branches are opened
out and held stiffly erect by a fleshy turgid cushion on the upper
(distal) side of the base of each. The branches of the rachis may
thus be said to be hinged, and with maturity the supporting cushion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>dries away and allows them to resume a direction nearly parallel
to that of the rachis.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dried fruits of <i>Acrista</i> are grayish brown in color and
nearly smooth or somewhat coriaceous in external texture; they
measure 11 or 12 mm. in length and are nearly as wide, being
slightly oboval in shape. The outer wall is thin and brittle and
covers a more or less distinct thin layer of amorphous brownish
material probably representing the pulp of the fresh fruit; in the dry
state this may adhere either to the outer wall or to the fibers next
inside. Near the base these fibers are simple, pointed and vertical;
about half way up they divide and anastomose and are, as it were,
felted and cemented together to form an oval sac open below and
closed above. The outer fibers are much coarser than the inner
and there are sometimes suggestions of three layers separated by
a dark-brown friable material. A few of the delicate inner fibers
are adnate to the surface of the seed which is otherwise free from
its fibrous covering.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seed 8.5 mm. by 8 mm., slightly lighter in color than the outside
of the fruit. Surface slightly uneven with obscure veinlike
ridges and impressions of the fibers of the outer covering. The
kernel is white, hard and bony, and deeply ruminate, though this
is not apparent from the outside. The channels are very narrow
and often radial and straight; they penetrate 3 mm. or less.
Embryo directly basal; hilum lateral, somewhat below the level
of the stigma; a short raphe extends about half way to the embryo.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Family COCACEAE</h3>

<p class='c016'>The cocoid palms are a distinctly American group, the African
oil-palm, <i>Elaeis Guineensis</i> and the cocoanut being the only outliers
of the family which have been supposed to be indigenous in the
Old World. South America is the center of distribution and is the
home of a large proportion of the two hundred or more species.
Only five genera reach Puerto Rico, and one of these, <i>Cocos</i>, was
probably not a native of the island.</p>

<h5 class='c017'>BACTRIS Jacquin, Stirp. Am. 279. <i>pl. 271.</i> 1763</h5>

<p class='c016'>The type of this genus, <i>Bactris minor</i> Jacquin, described from
the vicinity of Carthagena, Colombia, is a small spiny palm with
creeping rootstocks. The upright trunks are about an inch thick
and twelve feet high, with long spiny internodes. The fruits are
fleshy, purple, and about the size of a cherry. Several species of
<i>Bactris</i> are known from the West Indies though the generic name
has doubtless been applied rather loosely to all the small spiny
cocoid palms.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two following species of <i>Bactris</i> from Puerto Rico described
by Martius several decades ago seem not to have been secured by
recent collectors unless it be true, as suggested below, that one of
them, the simple-leaved <i>B. acanthophylla</i> applies to a young
<i>Curima</i>. Of <i>B. Pavoniana</i> the narrowly grass-like leaf-divisions
would be sufficiently characteristic to separate it at once from all
other palms known from Puerto Rico.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bactris acanthophylla</span> Martius, Palm. Orbign. 67</h5>

<p class='c016'>“Trunk low, spiny; frond simple, the petiole spiny; blade
lanceolate in young plants, oblong in the adult, cuneate at the
base and bifid at apex, the margin unequally erose, unarmed;
rachis and primary veins spiny on both sides; spines bristle-like,
narrowed at base, those of the petiole black, those of the blades
fuscous.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>“In the western part of the island of Puerto Rico, near the
village of Yrurena, in swampy places on the margins of aboriginal
forests at an altitude of 400 feet; collected by Wylder, 1827.”
(Martius Hist. Palm. <strong>3</strong>: 281.)</p>

<p class='c009'>A specimen to which the above diagnosis would not be inapplicable
was collected by Sintenis in the mountain forests near
Maricao (no. 484). It was distributed from Berlin as a <i>Martinezia</i>,
together with two other very young plants and a seed to
which one of these was attached.</p>

<p class='c009'>The seed evidently did not come from a cocoid palm but together
with the young seedlings may belong to <i>Acrista</i>. The
large spiny plant is probably a young specimen of <i>Curima</i>, and
should these suggestions prove to be correct the specific name
<i>acanthophylla</i> must be transferred to this genus though whether
it will replace <i>colophylla</i> or not is not to be determined until it can
be ascertained that the Maricao species is the same as that here
described from Bayamon.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bactris Pavoniana</span> Martius, Palm. Orbign. 70</h5>

<p class='c016'>“Frond pinnate, rachis with rather long spines and black bristles:
linear acuminate, about equally distant, the terminal united,
setose-ciliate, glaucous below and with a sparse whitish down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Puerto Rico; Pavon.” (Martius, Hist. Pal. <strong>3</strong>: 282.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Grisebach has reported this species from Antigua and has redescribed
it as follows, presumably from the Antigua specimens.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Trunk low’; <i>leaves pinnatisect: segments numerous, grass-like,
linear-acuminate</i> or the uppermost broader by cohesion, glaucous
and minutely puberulous or glabrescent beneath, approximate,
subequidistant, reduplicate at the base: <i>rachis armed with
very long black prickles</i> and rare bristles, keeled above.—Flowers
unknown; leaf segments (in our specimens, which are cut off,
perhaps about the middle of the rachis) more than 30–jugal, 3‴–6‴
distant, 12″–8″ long, 4‴–2‴ broad, superior gradually
shorter, the uppermost cohering ones sometimes 6‴–8‴ broad:
prickles scattered or clustered, slender, the greatest 2″ long.
Hab. Antigua: <i>Wullschl.</i>, Blubber valley; [Portorico].” (Grisebach,
Fl. Brit. W. I., 520. 1864.)</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><strong>Curima</strong> gen. nov.</h5>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Trunk rather slender, internodes armed with scattered slender
spines. Leaves and inflorescence also spiny, especially on the
proximal parts. Pinnae numerous, strap-shaped, praemorse-truncate,
imperfectly separated near the ends of the leaves. Inflorescence
rather slender, once-branched; pistillate flowers mostly
located near the bases of the branches. Fruit drupaceous, exocarp
fleshy, not fibrous; foramina peripheral.</p>

<p class='c009'>A palm related to <i>Acrocomia</i> and to the genera commonly
grouped under the name <i>Martinezia</i>, to which <i>Aiphanes</i> and <i>Marara</i>
are generally referred as synonyms. Reasons why none of these
names appears available for the Puerto Rico species are given below.
The characters of the fruit, with foramina near the middle, seem
to indicate that <i>Curima</i> is not remotely related to <i>Acrocomia</i>, from
which it differs superficially in the more slender habit, the truncate
or praemorse leaves and the very long and lax inflorescence.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><strong>Curima colophylla</strong> sp. nov. <a href='#pl_46'>Plate 46.</a></h5>

<p class='c016'>The solitary trunk rises from a mass of spiny roots somewhat
smaller than those of the llume palm (<i>Aeria</i>). Diameter of trunk
from 1–1.5 cm., often slightly thinner near the ground, though
showing no such tendency to bulge as appears in <i>Roystonea</i>, <i>Aeria</i>
and <i>Acrocomia</i>. The surface of the internodes is rather sparingly
provided with needle-like spines smaller and more slender than
those of <i>Acrocomia</i>. On old trunks the spines are often more or
less completely absent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaves 2.13–2.5 m. long, with from 30 to 40 pairs of strap-shaped
praemorse-truncate divisions shorter and broader as the
end of the leaf is approached, and with a terminal undivided
area several inches wide. There is no apparent tendency toward
the arrangement of the leaf-divisions in clusters as in <i>Martinezia
caryotaefolia</i> and other allied species.</p>

<p class='c009'>The base, rachis, midribs and even the surfaces of the pinnae
are beset with coarse black or deep red spines which are closely
appressed when young and become erect as soon as the surfaces
are exposed, all the parts except the spines and the upper surfaces
of the leaf-division being covered at first with a light grayish or
brownish scurfy coating which gradually disappears.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>The inner spathe is narrowly fusiform and about 1 m. long.
It splits to the level of the outer spathe revealing the spadix and
its extremely spiny peduncle. The flowers are greenish cream
colored in mass, paler and not so yellow as in <i>Acrocomia</i>. The
pistillate flowers are relatively very few and located near the base
of the simple branches.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cherry-like fruits are dull orange or brick red with rather
dry fleshy or oily exocarp having a rather mealy though distinctly
acid flavor, but no really unpleasant taste. This fleshy covering
is only very slightly fibrous, and that near the base; the seeds fall
off very easily sometimes leaving the base of the exocarp attached
to the fruiting branch. The nut is about 12 mm. in greatest or
transverse diameter and about 10 mm. high, while the fresh fruit
is 14–16 mm. through and 12 or 13 mm. thick. The surface is
deeply and irregularly pitted and marked with three radially fibrous
striate foveolae.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is perhaps too soon to assert that there is only one species
of the present genus in Puerto Rico. The trees certainly differ
considerably in size though not more than the cocoanut and others.
There is also a noticeable difference in the abundance of spines.
Such apparent variability may, however, be due to age, the older
trees tending to become less densely beset with the brittle black
spines which are often conspicuous on young specimens.</p>

<p class='c009'>The specimens (no. 878) and photographs on which this genus
and species were based were secured on the limestone hills near the
wagon road between Bayamon and Toa Baja where the present
palm is not uncommon.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Curima</i> appeared to be especially abundant about Bayamon
but is probably rather generally distributed in the limestone hills
of the island, perhaps also on other soils. A few trees were seen
along the road between Utuado and Lares, and numerous others
between Isolina and Manati. Sintenis collected specimens of what
is apparently the same species near Juncos and Hato Grande,
and at Maricao young specimens discussed under <i>Bactris acanthophylla</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>As far as Puerto Rico is concerned, this palm is very easily
recognized by means of the curiously truncate leaf-divisions, the
outer margins of which appear as though accidentally injured or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>eaten away by caterpillars. This feature is, however, shared with
numerous other West Indian and South American palms, though
apparently only one, the so-called <i>grigri</i> palm of Martinique
can be referred to the present genus with confidence. For this the
name <strong>Curima corallina</strong> (<i>Martinezia corallina</i> Martius, Hist. Nat.
Palm. 3: 284) appears to be correct, although Martius places
Gaertner’s much older <i>Bactris minima</i> as a synonym for his
species. Gaertner, however, was making a second attempt at renaming
Jacquin’s <i>Bactris minor</i>, having previously misplaced that
name in connection with a West Indian <i>Acrocomia</i>, probably the
same to which Jacquin had already supplied the name <i>Cocos aculeatus</i>.
Thus it is possible to treat <i>Bactris minima</i> Gaertner as a
synonym of <i>Bactris minor</i> Jacquin and the restoration of Gaertner’s
inappropriate name for the <i>Curima</i> is thus avoided.</p>

<p class='c009'>With this preliminary description we may return to the consideration
of the generic names <i>Martinezia</i>, <i>Aiphanes</i> and <i>Marara</i>
which other writers have applied to relatives of the present palm
or treated as synonyms. <i>Martinezia</i> was described by Ruiz and
Pavon (Prodr. Flor. Per. et Chil. 148. 1794) for five Peruvian
palms, but it was amended by Martius (Hist. Nat. Palm. <strong>3</strong>:
283) by the removal of all the original species and the substitution
of a new set. Of the original species studied by Ruiz and Pavon
only two, <i>M. ciliata</i> and <i>M. abrupta</i> were mentioned in connection
with the original description of the genus, and this because they
offered exceptions to the generic characters. If these were to be
excluded for this reason from those among which the type is to
be sought, the name <i>Martinezia</i> must go with the subsequently
published <i>M. ensiformis</i>, now referred to <i>Euterpe</i><a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a> or with <i>M.
lanceolata</i> and <i>M. linearis</i>, now placed in <i>Chamaedorea</i>. If we
hold to the first species, <i>M. ciliata</i>, <i>Martinezia</i> is probably a synonym
of <i>Bactris</i>. The second species, <i>M. abrupta</i>, has escaped
Martius and the Index Kewensis, in which a sixth name <i>M. interrupta</i>
is the only one by Ruiz and Pavon now credited as being a
genuine <i>Martinezia</i>. Thus by the method of elimination <i>Martinezia</i>
would according to current classification replace <i>Chamaedorea</i>
while by the method of types it would stand as a synonym of <i>Bactris</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The genus <i>Aiphanes</i> was established by Willdenow on <i>Aiphanes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>aculeata</i>, a spiny palm from the mountains about Caracas. The
trunk is said to be erect, ten meters high, subcylindrical and very
spiny. The leaves are about 1.6 m. long, with four pairs of remote,
broad, cuneate, praemorse pinnae, strongly whitish pubescent
on the under side; the petiole is also beset with spines. Spathe
acuminate at both ends, aculeate on the outside, smooth
within, opening longitudinally; spadix 4.5 dm. long, composed
of cylindrical spikes placed opposite. Flowers hermaphrodite;
calyx trifid, the divisions acute; petals acuminate; filaments 6,
subulate, anthers rounded, style as long as the stamens, stigma
trifid; drupe globose, the fleshy farinaceous pulp rather tasteless,
though edible; nut hard, of the size of a musket ball, unilocular,
black, furrowed with a large number of grayish grooves,
of which three are always much larger than the others. The kernel
is white, very sweet, and very good to eat. <i>Aiphanes</i> grows
in the ravines and forests of the high mountains of the district of
Caucagua, province of Caracas, Venezuela and requires a fertile,
somewhat moist soil. It flowers and fruits in July.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the above it appears that <i>Aiphanes</i> is a genus quite different
from <i>Curima</i>, approaching some of the South American
species of <i>Bactris</i> much more closely than it resembles the Puerto
Rico tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>The genus <i>Marara</i> was based by Karsten (Linnaea, <strong>28</strong>: 389)
on <i>M. bicuspidata</i> from Colombia, a cespitose palm having a trunk
7 meters high and 10 cm. in diameter, clothed with black spines 6
to 8 mm. long. The leaves are 125 cm. long with from 60 to 80
pairs of cuneate pinnules which measure 3 dm. in length and 15
cm. in width, and are clustered in sixes or eights. This appears
to be a very extreme development of the leaf-arrangement
seen in the cultivated palm commonly called <i>Martinezia caryotaefolia</i>
where the leaflets are distinctly clustered, but by no means
so crowded as must be the case when on the side of a leaf 125
cm. long are leaflets with an aggregate width of 10–13 m.</p>

<p class='c009'>The palm commonly cultivated in conservatories as <i>Martinezia
caryotaefolia</i> is obviously allied to <i>Curima</i>, perhaps more closely
than to either <i>Aiphanes</i> or <i>Marara</i>, but in addition to the clustered
pinnules it has a more slender habit, especially apparent in the
long internodes and the more lax inflorescence. This difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>in habit is also evidently correlated with the fact that the leaf-bases
do not become deeply gibbous and obliquely inclined from
the trunk as in <i>Curima</i> but remain closely sheathing. Moreover,
the upper side of the leaf-stalk which in the Puerto Rico palm is
deeply channeled and has lateral corners sharp or torn into fibers
nearly to the insertion of the lowest pinnae is in the conservatory
species nearly cylindrical for a long distance below the pinnae,
and has long spines on the upper side as well as on the lower.
It is as though the ligule were located in <i>Curima</i> near the insertion
of the lowest pinnae while in the other form it remains close
to the trunk, with a cylindrical section intercalated to reach to
where the pinnae begin. Apparently we are dealing with still
another generic group for which the name <strong>Tilmia</strong> would not
be inappropriate in allusion to the shorn and disheveled appearance
which it shares with <i>Curima</i>. The species studied are <strong>Tilmia caryotaefolia</strong>
(<i>Martinezia caryotaefolia</i> H.B.K. Nov. Gen. et Sp. <strong><span class='fss'>I</span></strong>: 305.
<i>pl. 699</i>) in the National Botanic Garden and <strong>T. disticha</strong> (<i>Martinezia
disticha</i> Linden, Cat. 32. 1875).</p>

<p class='c009'>The seeds of <i>Tilma caryotaefolia</i> are like those of <i>Curima</i>, but
considerably larger, rounder, and much smoother. The foramina
are peripheral, but are much smaller and more shallow, those of
<i>Curima</i> being surrounded, as it were, by a prominent rim which
adds somewhat to the apparent width of the seed. In both genera
the nuts are unsymmetrical, the side which has the largest foramen
being distinctly larger than the others and in <i>Curima</i> the irregularly
pitted sculpture is coarser.</p>

<h5 class='c017'>ACROCOMIA Martius, Hist. Nat. Palm. <strong>2</strong>: 66</h5>

<p class='c016'>A genus of palms distributed through tropical America from
Mexico to Cuba and Paraguay. All the species are of stocky,
compact growth, with a dense crown of numerous leaves. The
trunk and the leaf-stalks are usually armed with strong, sharp
spines, sometimes several inches long.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although totally different on close inspection this genus has in
Puerto Rico a superficial resemblance to the royal palm, which
often deceives travelers. The similarity lies mostly in the two facts
that both the royal and corozo palms are more robust and stiffly
erect than the cocoanut, and that the leaf-divisions instead of lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>horizontal and in one plane are tilted at different angles to the midrib,
thus giving the foliage seen in the mass a somewhat unkempt
appearance in comparison with the cocoanut.</p>

<p class='c009'>In distinguishing the corozo palm from the royal palm when
seen at a distance so great that the spines of the one and the
columnar green leaf-sheaths of the other can not be seen, recourse
may be had to the following facts. The leaf crown of the corozo
palm is much rounder, thicker and more compact than that of the
royal palm, since it contains many more leaves, and these persist
much longer. The royal palm can also be known by the unopened
leaves which project straight upward like flag-poles or
lightning-rods, while in <i>Acrocomia</i> the leaves open as they are
pushed out and seldom offer a suggestion of the spire-like effect.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><strong>Acrocomia media</strong> sp. nov.</h5>

<p class='c020'>Trunk 20–30 cm. in diameter near the base, thickened above
to 50 cm. or less; height commonly about 6–8 m. rarely exceeding
10 m. Surface of trunk with slight annular impressions. Internodes
armed with slender black spines, the larger 10–15 cm. long,
mostly confined to the lower half of the internodes. Fruit green, becoming
yellowish, the husk firmly fibrous, inedible; about 35 mm.
in diameter, nearly spherical in shape, with a distinct apical papilla.
Kernel 25 mm. wide by 22 mm. long; width of the cavity 18 mm.
The type specimen was collected near Ponce (photograph no. 255).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Acrocomia</i> of Puerto Rico seems to differ from <i>A. aculeata</i>
(Jacquin) in its robust habit and somewhat bulging trunk, while it
is less stout and less swollen than <i>A. fusiformis</i> (Swartz). The
name <i>Acrocomia lasiospatha</i>, although used by Martius and Grisebach
has no warrant for supplanting <i>fusiformis</i> of Swartz, which must
be preferred for the Jamaica species with the thick, swollen trunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Jamaica there seem to be at least two species of <i>Acrocomia</i>,
the larger of which is called the “great macaw” palm, and is described
as having a fusiform trunk as thick as a man’s body.
What is presumably the same species occurs in Cuba as shown by
a photograph from the vicinity of La Gloria on the north coast.
The greatest diameter of the trunk is three or four times the thickness
near the base. In Puerto Rico no trees approximating these
proportions were observed, the greatest amount of swelling probably
not reaching twice the diameter below. According to Maza
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span><i>Acrocomia lasiospatha</i> grows wild in Cuba and is known under the
name “coroja de Jamaica.” Swartz described his <i>Cocos fusiformis</i>
on the supposition that it was distinct from the <i>Cocos aculeatus</i> of
Jacquin, from Martinique, by reason of the fusiform trunk. The
species was, nevertheless, reduced by Martius to his South American
<i>Acrocomia sclerocarpa</i>, perhaps because the spathe is said to
be spiny, a character probably subject to great variation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacquin’s name <i>Acrocomia aculeata</i> (1763) must, it seems, be
used for the West Indian palm placed by Martius under his <i>A.
sclerocarpa</i>, which is to be maintained, if at all, as a South American
species. Jacquin declares that the habit of his tree is similar
to that of <i>Cocos nucifera</i> and <i>Cocos amara</i> (<i>Syagrus</i>), and his
figure shows a tall straight trunk tapering slightly upward, with
no tendency to bulge. The spines of the trunk are few and the
midribs are aculeate on both sides. The drawing of the fruit is
37 mm. long by 41 mm. wide and has a broad conic papilla
at apex. As indicated above, such a tree was not noticed in Puerto
Rico where all the corozo palms are distinctly, though slightly,
thicker some distance above the base, though apparently never
equaling <i>A. fusiformis</i> in this respect.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>Subfamily <span class='sc'>Cocinae</span></h4>

<h5 class='c017'>Key to the Genera of Cocinae</h5>

<p class='c011'>Trunk distinctly ringed, rising from an inclined swollen base; leaves numerous, many
of the lower drooping or pendant, the divisions many and narrow; fruits very large,
borne continuously.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Cocos.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Trunk nearly smooth, straight and columnar; leaves fewer, not becoming pendant, divisions
less numerous and broader; fruits small, borne at one time and ripening together.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Cocops.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h5 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Cocos nucifera</span> Linn. Sp. Pl. 1188. 1753</h5>

<p class='c016'>The cocoa-palm is largely confined to the neighborhood of
the coast, but is occasionally planted in small numbers in the interior
districts, though it generally does not thrive in such situations
especially on the north side of the island. On the drier
southern slope of Puerto Rico, which is avoided by the royal palm,
the cocoanut seems to thrive better, when it has once become established.
Cocoanuts are mostly gathered while still green, for
the sake of the milk or, as it is there called, the water (<i>coco de
agua</i>) a popular beverage wherever obtainable. Although the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>local consumption of nuts for this purpose is considerable it is
largely confined to the towns of the coast region. Thus it may
be said that in Puerto Rico the cocoa-palm affords a luxury rather
than a necessity, and that it is exceeded in economic importance
by the royal palm.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><strong>Cocops</strong> gen. nov.</h5>

<p class='c016'>In a valley on the road between Lares and San Sebastian several
young palms were noticed with leaves similar to the cocoanut,
but smaller and finer. Finally one mature specimen was found,
with both trunk and leaves strongly suggesting the cocoanut, but
much smaller. The leaves are light green, the leaflets in one
plane, and the fibers separating from the narrow base of the leaf.
The fibers are few and flimsy, but like those of the cocoanut and
other South American species of <i>Cocos</i>. The palm stood within a
few feet of a small permanent brook, down which the seeds had
evidently been carried and there were several young palms along
the bank. The native living in an adjacent house could give us no
name except <i>palmilla</i>, and seemed to think that none was necessary
since the tree does not yield <i>yagua</i> or anything else of use.
Its early extermination is therefore not unlikely.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the absence of flowers and fruit<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> the relationships of the present
genus cannot be ascertained nor its validity satisfactorily established.
There seems, however, to be no reason for including the
species in any of the genera known from Puerto Rico or other parts
of the West Indies, and to associate it with Central and South
American types would be a still less warrantable procedure.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is also believed that under the present circumstances the application
of a name is justified by convenience of reference and that
this will also assist in securing the attention of botanical collectors
better than a mere allusion to “an unknown palm which may
be new.”</p>

<h5 class='c017'><strong>Cocops rivalis</strong> sp. nov.</h5>

<p class='c016'>In diameter the trunk appeared to be about midway between
the palma de sierra (<i>Acrista</i>) and the cocoanut, and had the short
internodes of the latter. The leaves, however, probably remain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>somewhat smaller than those of <i>Acrista</i> to which they might
also be said to have a general similarity, except at the base where
their cocoid proclivities become obvious. At a little distance
<i>Cocops</i> might be overlooked as <i>Acrista</i>, while at shorter range it
might be mistaken for a very depauperate cocoanut. No species
of <i>Cocos</i> is, however, known to be native in the West Indies except
the doubtful <i>Cocos crispus</i> H.B.K., from Cuba.</p>

<p class='c009'>As a species <i>Cocops rivalis</i> may prove to be similar to <i>Syagrus
amara</i> (Jacquin), which is reported as far north as Jamaica, but it
seems to have no true generic affinity with <i>Syagrus cocoides</i> Martius,
the South American palm which is the type of its genus.
According to Martius <i>S. amara</i> is 30 cm. in diameter, as large or
larger than <i>Cocos nucifera</i> and attains the height of from 20 to 35
meters; <i>Syagrus cocoides</i>, on the other hand, is a small slender
palm with a trunk 2.5–3 m. high and 5–7.5 cm. in diameter, and
with foliage and habit resembling the slender and diffuse South
American species referred by Martius to <i>Cocos</i>, but very different
from <i>Cocos nucifera</i> or from <i>Cocops</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>A leaf collected by Sintenis (no. 6061) near Camuy and
coming from Berlin labeled <i>Oreodoxa</i>, obviously did not originate
with an arecoid palm, but probably belongs with the present
species. The region of Camuy is but a few miles from Lares,
but there is much extremely rough and unoccupied country between,
so that the danger of extermination appears to be somewhat
diminished.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Of numerous insects distinctive of the more southern palmetto the most conspicuous
is a longicorn beetle, <i>Agallissus chamaeropis</i> Horn, the larvae of which bore in
the leaf-bases. The more common <i>Inodes</i> is inhabited by the allied genus <i>Zagymnus</i>,
though another species of <i>Agallissus</i> is reported from Texas, where the native <i>Inodes</i>
is of the smooth-trunked type.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. </p>
<p class='c021'><strong>Inodes vestita</strong> sp. nov. Trunk about 45 cm. thick at base, columnar or tapering
upward; surface rimose, the chinks commonly 5 mm. wide and 20 mm. apart. Leaf-bases
torn into very numerous, fine, hair-like, light reddish-brown fibers, a few much
coarser than the others and measuring from .6 to 1 mm. in diameter. The epidermis
separates into delicate membranous shreds, the surface of which is delicately pitted and
sparsely beset with brownish hairy-margined peltate scales. Petiole 10 cm. or upward
in width below near where it begins to split, 4.5 cm. wide at base of ligule; 3 m. long,
concave above; blade 2.13 m. long, 2.50 m. wide, composed of about 60 segments, the
apical united more than two-thirds their length, the basal for less than one-third; apical
segments 4.5 cm. wide, deeply divided above, a long fiber terminating both the longer
and the shorter ribs.</p>

<p class='c009'>As shown by the rimose bark this species affords a rather extreme instance of the
gradual enlargement of the trunk at a distance from the growing point. Numerous leaf-bases
remain attached to the trunk in the greenhouse as they would not do in nature,
since they are torn loose except for a few fibers at the extreme sides.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Dr. Rose also kindly permits the use of the following field notes and measurements
showing that <i>Inodes Rosei</i> is also a taller and more slender tree than <i>I. Uresana</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Trees 6–12 or sometimes even 18 meters high, the long slender naked trunk 15–20
cm. in diameter, crowned with a large cluster of leaves; petioles 60 cm. or more long,
flat on the face, pubescent, but becoming glabrate; blade pale green, 8 cm. or more in
width, strongly keeled, more or less clothed beneath with brown scales on the large
veins; segments cleft to below the middle, 25 mm. or less wide; inflorescence in large
branching panicles 60 cm. or more long; fruit spherical, 18 mm. in diameter, blackish
or dark blue when mature.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A very common tree east of Rosario towards Mazatlan, also extending all the way
from Rosario to Acaponeta; especially common on the low hills, and east of Rosario
toward the mountains. This species is of considerable economic importance, the trunks
being used in building fences, corrals and huts, while the leaves appear as thatch on a
majority of the houses of this region.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
